# User Stories:
* As a user I want to be able to easily enter and manage my recipes.

* As a user I want to be able to tag recipes so that I can organize and filter them
* As a user I want to be able to tell the meal planner which types of recipes to include based on tags.
* As a user I want to get a shopping list so that I don't have to look up ingredients separately
* As a user I want to be sure that I'm using my own favorite recipes, not other people's
* As a user I want to be able to export my meal plan to a calendar app so that I have a record of what I'll cook when.

# Developer Stories
* As a developer I want to use Django's built-in user auth model, for easier auth-auth management.
* As a developer I want modular code to make development of new features easier.
* As a developer I want to use existing APIs and modules so that I can avoid duplicating other's work.
